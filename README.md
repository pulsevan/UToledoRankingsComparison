# UToledoRankingsComparison
 
This was a midterm project for a Data Visualization course I took in Fall 2023. The project was to examine a dataset which contained school rankings and compare the University of Toledo's ranking and stats to the other schools in the same rank and the rank above it. Analysis was just based on comparing the numbers rather than testing, but it was good experience using PowerBI.

The analysis on the second page of the dashboard was supposed to explain my investigation of the University of Toledo's rankings vs other schools, and provide suggestions for improvement. The suggestions were meant to be in the realm of possibility and not just "simply spend more money."
